ENTITY CHECKING

To avoid linearly searching through lists of entities during environment testing,
the world is carved up with an evenly spaced, axially aligned bsp tree.  Entities
are kept in chains either at the final leafs, or at the first node that splits
them, which prevents having to deal with multiple fragments of a single entity.
