 VM Considerations

 The VM can not use the standard system headers because we aren't really
 using the compiler they were meant for.  We use bg_lib.h which contains
 prototypes for the functions we define for our own use in bg_lib.c.

 When writing mods, please add needed headers HERE, do not start including
 stuff like <stdio.h> in the various .c files that make up each of the VMs
 since you will be including system headers files can will have issues.

 Remember, if you use a C library function that is not defined in bg_lib.c,
 you will have to add your own version for support in the VM.
