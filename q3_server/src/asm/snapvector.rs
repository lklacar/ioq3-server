 VM Considerations

 The VM can not use the standard system headers because we aren't really
 using the compiler they were meant for.  We use bg_lib.h which contains
 prototypes for the functions we define for our own use in bg_lib.c.

 When writing mods, please add needed headers HERE, do not start including
 stuff like <stdio.h> in the various .c files that make up each of the VMs
 since you will be including system headers files can will have issues.

 Remember, if you use a C library function that is not defined in bg_lib.c,
 you will have to add your own version for support in the VM.

**********************************************************************/

// expand constants before stringifying them
// angle indexes
// up / down
// left / right
// fall over
// the game guarantees that no string from the network will ever
// exceed MAX_STRING_CHARS
// max length of a string passed to Cmd_TokenizeString
// max tokens resulting from Cmd_TokenizeString
// max length of an individual token
// used for system info key only
// max length of a quake game pathname
// max length of a client name
// parameters for command buffer stuffing
// don't return until completed, a VM should NEVER use this,
// because some commands might cause the VM to be unloaded...
// insert at current position, but don't run yet
// add to end of the command buffer (normal case)
//
// these aren't needed by any of the VMs.  put in another header?
//
// bit vector of area visibility
// print levels from renderer (FIXME: set up for game / cgame?)
// only print when "developer 1"

// don't kill server
