VM_Call


Upon a system call, the stack will look like:

sp+32	parm1
sp+28	parm0
sp+24	return stack
sp+20	return address
sp+16	local1
sp+14	local0
sp+12	arg1
sp+8	arg0
sp+4	return stack
sp		return address

An interpreted function will immediately execute
an OP_ENTER instruction, which will subtract space for
locals from sp
